# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

if number % 2 == 1:
	print('The number is odd')
else:
	print('The number is even')
#ItÂ´s important to know that the modulo gives 0 when the number is even and 1 when the number is odd
#So, another way to code this challenge is:

if number % 2 == 0:
	print('Even')
else:
	print('Odd')
